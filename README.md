### 💡 About Me

I'm a **self-taught, design-driven developer** with a love for turning abstract ideas into real-world applications. My journey began with an old Lenovo laptop and a ton of curiosity, which sparked a deep interest in how things work behind the screen. That spark led me to pursue a **degree in Computer Science**, where I blended my creativity and logic into full-stack development.

> Whether it's crafting elegant interfaces or designing robust backends, I thrive in bridging functionality with form.

When I’m not coding, I recharge by watching anime 🎌 or playing mobile games 🎮—my way of staying balanced while doing what I love.
