### 💻 About Me

Ever since I got my hands on an old Lenovo laptop, a blank Notepad, and Google Chrome, I've been driven by curiosity about how things work behind the screen. From building simple websites to creating full-stack applications, my journey has been fueled by self-learning, determination, and a strong passion for technology.

I pursued a degree in Computer Science to deepen my knowledge and turn my childhood passion into a meaningful career. I also found myself gravitating toward UI/UX design, which led me to specialize in full-stack development—bridging functionality with creativity.

When I’m not building something new, you’ll probably catch me watching anime or playing mobile games to keep life fun and balanced.
