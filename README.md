### 💻 About Me

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been naturally curious about technology. It all started with an old Lenovo laptop, Notepad, and Google Chrome. From there, I began teaching myself how to build simple projects by following tutorials and diving into documentation. That curiosity eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, turning a childhood interest into a lifelong passion.

Over time, I discovered a love for graphics and design, which pushed me to explore full-stack development. I enjoy combining the logic of programming with the creativity of design, allowing me to build user-friendly and visually engaging applications.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing mobile games or watching anime, just my way of keeping life balanced while doing what I love.
